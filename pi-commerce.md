Welcome, PiOS Developers! This guide is designed to facilitate team formation and collaboration for those participating in the Pi Commerce Hackathon.

[Video walkthrough of the app](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uu8ccbqEcA)

## Getting Started
Team leaders are encouraged to create a GitHub repository for their project and list it here. This allows other developers to discover and contribute to projects that align with their interests and expertise, fostering effective collaboration right from the start.

To see Mockups and Prototypes created by the Pi Core Team and shared with the PiOS license check out the [pi-commerce-app](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-commerce-app) repository. 

## Adding Your Project
To add your project to this page:
1. **Incorporate the PiOS License**: Your code repository must include the PiOS license. Obtain it [here](https://github.com/pi-apps/PiOS/blob/main/LICENSE). Remember to customize the Copyright section of the LICENSE file in your repo.
2. **Link Your Repository**: Use the template provided below to add your project to the list. Ensure you fill in all the relevant details about your app.

Copy the format below, add it to the bottom of the table, and update it with your app's details.

### For Projects under Active Development
If your app is progressing significantly, the Pi Core Team may offer to host your repository under the `pi-apps` organization on GitHub (github.com/pi-apps). This is to ensure that promising projects are easily discoverable and well-supported. The winning app, if built using PiOS, will receive further support from the Pi Core Team, including server resources to ensure app stability and the removal of cost barriers, up to a specified cap.


## Roles and Responsibilities of Team Leaders
Team leaders are responsible for:
- Creating and managing the project's GitHub repository.
- Overseeing technical tasks, code reviews, and pull request approvals.
- Coordinating the efforts of team members.
- Ensuring adherence to development milestones.
- Setting up the app in the Pi Developer Portal.
- Submitting the final app at the hackathon's conclusion.

### Disclaimer
While PiOS is a recommended license for Pi Network applications, its usage does not imply endorsement or responsibility by the Pi Network for your project. It's advisable to consult legal counsel to ensure the license aligns with your project's needs. Your use of the PiOS license is at your own risk, and you're liable for any consequences that arise from it.
