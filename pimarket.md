## 🚀 How Pi is Used:

PiMarket is built entirely around **Pi as the primary currency**.  
Every product listing is priced in π, with real-time conversion from local currency via the **Bitget API**.  
Future updates will include **direct Pi Wallet payments** and an **escrow system** for added security.  
The system requires **no fiat, no banks, no intermediaries** – just **Pi and people**.

## 🌍 Why This Project Matters:

PiMarket addresses real-world needs in **emerging regions**, where:
- access to stable financial platforms is limited,  
- fiat currencies are often unstable or unavailable,  
- but **mobile devices and Pi accounts are widely used**.

This creates an opportunity to **unlock real economic value** using Pi –  
enabling local trade of goods and services **without middlemen, without fiat**.

The platform is:
- 💻 **100% open source (PiOS)**,  
- 📱 mobile-ready and lightweight,  
- 🚫 completely independent of app stores and traditional payment processors.
